# Problem Statement

Implement a Re-Order Buffer (ROB)

# Commentary

A Re-order Buffer (ROB) is a commonly block used to recover order in a
stream of data when completions can arrive out of order. The principle
of operation is fairly simple: items/data is allocated in sequential
order and provided with a unique tag (an identifier). Upon completion,
the original tag is returned and any ancillary state retained. Tags
are dellocated in sequential order to recover the original ordering.

Although the use of a ROB may be unavoidable, its introduction
introduces latency into a system because ordering is typically
employed in non-blocking memory subsystems to improve performance. The
ROB must be sized such that it may maintain at least the maximum
number of inflight transactions plus some overhead to account for the
'out-of-orderedness'.
